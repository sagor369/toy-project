          An access token and a refresh token are commonly used in
          authentication and authorization systems. Here's an overview of what
          they are, how they work, and where they should be An access token is a
          credential that is used to authenticate and authorize a client to
          access protected resources or perform certain actions on a server. It
          is typically a short-lived token with an expiration time, usually
          ranging from minutes to hours.
        </p>
        <p>
          Access tokens should be stored on the client-side in a secure manner
          to prevent unauthorized access. One common approach is to store access
          tokens in memory or a secure token storage mechanism provided by the
          client platform (e.g., Keychain for iOS, SharedPreferences for
          Android). It is essential to avoid storing access tokens in vulnerable
          locations such as local storage or cookies, as they can be susceptible
          to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Refresh tokens, being
          long-lived and more sensitive, should be stored in a highly secure
          manner.It's important to note that best practices for token management
          may vary based on the specific authentication and authorization
          framework or library you are using. Always refer to the documentation
          and security guidelines provided by the framework or library to ensure
          secure token handling.

        <h1>SQL & NoSQL </h1>
        <p>
          SQL: SQL databases follow a rigid, predefined schema with structured
          tables and relationships. They use a tabular format where data is
          organized into rows and columns. databases typically scale vertically
          by adding more resources (e.g., CPU, memory) to a single server.
          Scaling horizontally across multiple servers can be complex and may
          require data partitioning or sharding techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
          NoSQL: NoSQL databases offer a flexible schema or schema-less design.
          They allow for the storage of unstructured or semi-structured data,
          often using key-value pairs, document-like structures, graphs, or
          wide-column stores.NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally
          with ease. They distribute data across multiple servers, allowing for
          seamless scalability and handling of large volumes of data.

          Express.js is a popular and minimalist web application framework for
          Node.js. It provides a set of robust features and utilities to build
          web applications and APIs. Express.js is known for its simplicity and
          flexibility, allowing developers to create server-side applications
          with ease. Key features of Express.js include: Routing: Express.js
          provides a straightforward routing mechanism that allows developers to
          define routes for different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE,
          etc.) and handle requests and responses accordingly. Middleware:
          Express.js allows the use of middleware functions that can be executed
          before processing a request. Middleware functions can handle tasks
          like logging, authentication, parsing request bodies, and more.

          NestJS is a progressive, TypeScript-based web application framework
          for building efficient, scalable, and maintainable server-side
          applications. It is inspired by Angular and combines elements of
          object-oriented programming, functional programming, and reactive
          programming. Key features of NestJS include: Modularity: NestJS
          encourages modular architecture, enabling developers to organize the
          application into modules that encapsulate related functionality. Each
          module consists of controllers, services, and providers. Decorators
          and Dependency Injection: NestJS leverages TypeScript decorators and
          dependency injection to simplify the development of server-side
          applications. Decorators are used to define routes, middleware, and
          other metadata, while dependency injection manages the instantiation
          and injection of dependencies into application components.

        <h1>MongoDB</h1>
        <p>
          In MongoDB, the aggregate function is a powerful feature that allows
          you to perform advanced data aggregation operations on your data. It
          provides a flexible and expressive way to process and transform data
          within the database. The aggregate function works by creating a
          pipeline of stages that are executed in sequence, allowing you to
          apply various operations and transformations to your data. The basic
          structure of an aggregate pipeline in MongoDB consists of an array of
          stages, where each stage represents a specific operation or
          transformation. The stages are processed in the order they appear in
          the pipeline
